Assignment: Homework P2.4

Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. 
Your program’s inputs should be:

• The cost of a new car
• The estimated miles driven per year
• The estimated gas price
• The estimated resale value after 5 years

Compute the total cost of owning the car for 5 years. (For simplicity, we will not take the
cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid 
and a comparable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using today’s gas price and 15,000 miles 
per year. Include pseudocode and the program runs with your assignment.
