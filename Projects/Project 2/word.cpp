Assignment: Project 2, Task 1

The first task that you have to undertake is to set the width of the line for the new document. 
To do this you must read from an input .txt document where the settings of the document will be indicated on the first line.

NOTE: You will have to use ifstream for taking in the file and ofstream for generating the output file.

For example an input.txt will start with:

60;output.txt;
What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

Speaking of books, I love books. I read and write, sometimes at the same time because why not! Why should
I be limited by my measily brain and only do one task at a time? Exactly.

Well, thank you for listening. I appreciate you all :)

The number 60 on this case will indicate the max width of characters your output document will hold on every line. 
The second parameter should be the name of the output text file where your formatted document will be stored, which in 
this case itâ€™s output.txt. Please keep in mind that each of the settings on the first line are seperated by a ; with no space in between.

Based on the example input file shown above, our output.txt should look something like this 
after running it through our amazing Word formatter:

$ ./word
$ Enter the input filename: input.txt

NOTE: Each paragraph, even though the amount of lines changed, stayed as their own paragraphs.
